Exploratory Data Analysis on Synthetic Customer Survey Data
Project Overview
This project focuses on strengthening foundational data science skills by analyzing a synthetically generated customer survey dataset. The goal is to gain hands-on experience working with data from creation through analysis, rather than relying on pre-cleaned datasets.

The dataset represents hypothetical customer satisfaction scores along with basic demographic and behavioral information.
Objectives
- Generate a synthetic dataset using Python
- Perform basic data cleaning and validation
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Create visualizations to explore patterns and relationships
- Build confidence in end-to-end exploratory data analysis
Dataset Description
Numerical Columns:
- Age
- Satisfaction Score
- Purchase Frequency

Categorical Column:
- Region
Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
Methodology
1. Generate synthetic customer survey data programmatically
2. Inspect and clean the dataset if required
3. Perform descriptive statistical analysis
4. Analyze data distribution and variability
5. Create visualizations to highlight key insights
Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of dataset structure
- Summary statistics of customer attributes
- Initial insights into customer satisfaction patterns
- Identification of potential relationships between variables
Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis project provides practical experience in handling data from inception to insight, reinforcing essential data science concepts and analytical thinking.
